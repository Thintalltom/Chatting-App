# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

I am currently working on creating a fullstack social media web application using the following technologies: RecatJs, Nodejs, MySQL and ExpressJs 
Benefits of working on this projects includes:
* Sharpening my logical and manipulative thinking 
* Understanding how to write code efficiently and use external tools efficiently 
This project is inspired by facebook. 
Though it might not be 100% perfect but its a work in progressive towards being a fullstack dev.
